# Music-Emotion-Analysis
 
In this project, we try to use SVM and CNN to analysis the emotion of every song or melody.

We defined four regima by using arousal and valence, so the regima are correspond to four emotion, happy, tensional, sad, and peacful.

I also build a GUI for a great interface to use this program.
